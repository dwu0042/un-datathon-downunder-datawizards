## Project Description

Despite significant progress, over 600 million people remain without electricity worldwide, and by 2030, another 2 billion may still depend on polluting energy sources. Our initiative leverages high resolution satellite imaging data to pinpoint global sweetspots for solar farm installation. Our modelling approach not only identifies regions most in need but also determines locations which maximise the potential energy output. Our tool will facilitate strategic planning for solar farm installation, representing a transformative step towards closing the global energy divide.
